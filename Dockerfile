# VITAL: To ensure the secrets are available at RUNTIME in the final image, 
# you should typically define them as ENV variables here. However, since
# you are using Next.js's standalone output, these are often baked into 
# the server.js file if they were present during build.

# If the secrets are only needed during the build (prerendering/SSG), 
# this stage is fine as is. If they are needed for runtime SSR/API routes, 
# you must expose them as ENV variables here, and Cloud Build must pass them
# as ENV variables to the final container environment (e.g., in a deployment manifest).


# Uncomment and use this if the secrets are also required at runtime for SSR/API routes:
